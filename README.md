# TSJulia: TheTensor.Space Julia
Tensor Space Functionality for Julia Programming Platform.

[TheTensor.Space](https://TheTensor.Space/) is an open-source research project dedicated to studying the data types and algorithms for extracting information form high valence tables of numbers, what the sciences call a **tensor**.  The data comes in looking like this:<br/>

Using the algebra of operators on tensors we recover oncover new frames of reference were the data reveals internal properties such as the following.

Our algorithms are provided in a number of platforms. 
  * The bleeding edge algorithms are developed and tested for [Magma Computer Algebra System](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).  Core tensor algorithms are distributed with that system and you can follow [TheTensor.Space](https://TheTensor.Space/) for details on extensions and experimental additions.
  * Python access is available to core algorithms through [SageTensorSpace](https://github.com/thetensor-space/SageTensorSpace) for the [Sage Math](https://www.sagemath.org/) (in Python).
  * [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language port is being developed as [TSJulia](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TSJulia).

The algorithms presented in this tutorial are for instructional purposes.  For detailed treatments and improved performance follow the attached references.

### Installing TSJulia.

 - Make sure to have a recent installation of the Julia Language, v. > 1.7.0 seems to compatabile with the features required for TSJulia.  If you do not have an installation of Julia follow the installation instructions for the Julia system available [here](https://julialang.org/).
 - Clone or Download the TSJulia release from github [here](https://github.com/thetensor-space/TSJulia).  Make sure `julia` can be run from whatever folder contains your `TSJulia` download, typically by ensuring that `julia` is in the path of your operating system shell.
 - From the command line start julia and load the `TSJulia` package by using `include("$path$/TSJulia/TSJulia.jl")`
