# OpenDleto
Dleto, which means chisel, is a package of tools to carve information out of tensor data. This is an early release simplified implementation of a larger project of research methods developed in multiple languages.  Visit  [TheTensor.Space](https://TheTensor.Space/) for the main project.

## What can we find?
Using the algebra of operators on tensors the Dleto methods recover change of coordinates into which tensor data is supported on a smaller valence.  For 3-tensors

this means a to cluster the data near a block array of 2-tensors.  Here is what this looks like in some examples.

## Install

We have packaged just the essentials into a single file `Delto.jl` which has rudimentary but stand-alone implementations of some of the chiseling methods.  You may download that file alone, but you may also benefit from using the examples in `examples/..`.  Start with `examples/Demo.jl`.

 - Make sure to have a recent installation of the Julia Language, v. > 1.7.0 seems to compatabile with the features required for `OpenDleto`.  If you do not have an installation of Julia follow the installation instructions for the Julia system available [here](https://julialang.org/).
 - Clone or Download the `OpenDleto` release from github [here](https://github.com/thetensor-space/OpenDleto).  Make sure `julia` can be run from whatever folder contains your `OpenDleto` download, typically by ensuring that `julia` is in the path of your operating system shell.
 - From the command line start julia and load the `OpenDleto` package by using `include("$path$/OpenDleto/OpenDleto.jl")`
---
The functions mostly require standard Julia packages like `Random` and `LinearAlgebra`. The only other requirement is the package `Arpack` which will be installed by the above include command. It is recommended that this package is manually installed by and lines 5-6 in the file are commented out

```julia
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("Arpack")
```

The code can be used without `Arpack` but it will run significantly slower. One needs to comment out the function `ArpackEigen` (lines 274-282) and change the defult function in from `ArpackEigen` to `LinearAlgebraEigen` in the function `toSurfaceTensor`, `toFaceCurveTensor` and `ToCurveTensor` (lines 358, 396  and 436)


Our algorithms are provided in a number of platforms.   
  * The bleeding edge algorithms are developed and tested for [Magma Computer Algebra System](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).  Core tensor algorithms are distributed with that system and you can follow [TheTensor.Space](https://TheTensor.Space/) for details on extensions and experimental additions.
  * Python access is available to core algorithms through [SageTensorSpace](https://github.com/thetensor-space/SageTensorSpace) for the [Sage Math](https://www.sagemath.org/) (in Python).
  * [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language port is being developed as [OpenDelto](https://github.com/thetensor-space/OpenDleto).

The algorithms presented in this tutorial are for instructional purposes.  For detailed treatments and improved performance follow the attached references.
