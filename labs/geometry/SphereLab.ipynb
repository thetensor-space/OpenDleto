    "Dleto works by detecting a hidden constraint equation in a given tensor.  So far the tensors we created are obviously equations of a sphere.  So what we do next is randomize the bases of the x, y, and z axes.  In the case of our original sphere with radius 5 the entire tensor fit inside $11 \\times 11 \\times 11$-array.  This means that are operating in 3 different 11-dimensional vector spaces.  So we apply a random $11 \\times 11$ invertible matrix $X$ to the slices `tensor[i,:,:]`, an invertible matrix $Y$ to each slice `tensor[:,j,:]` and finally an invertible matrix $Z$ to the each `tensor[:,:,k]`.  If you changed the dimensions then the relevant matrix sizes will change accordingly.  The command `randomTensor` uses the arrays internally stored dimensions to calculate the appropriate changes.  The return includes not only the resulting tensor but also the matrices $X,Y,Z$ used to affect the change.  To access the resulting tensor use the record name `.tensor`.  To access the coordinate changes use `.Xes`, `.Yes` and `.Zes`.\n",

So the effect is that the sphere has been folded in half along the x-axis to make a hemisphere twice as thick, then along the y-axis to make a quarter sphere 4 times as thick, and then along the z-axis to make an octant 8 times as thick. For a discreted sphere there may be fewer than 8 points in alignment which means the blocks may be thinner.\n",

The random choices make subtle rounding differences which can in close cases permute adjecent blocks.  For a highly discrete surface like the radius 5 sphere these permutation may be more noticeable but they still cluster along a discrete 8-think octant of a sphere.  With higher resolutions these permutations become less perceptible. "
